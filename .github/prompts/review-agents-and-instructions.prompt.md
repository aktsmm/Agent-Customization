# Prompt: Review Agents & Instructions

Prompt for reviewing agent definitions (.agent.md) and instruction files (.github/instructions/\*_/_.md) with cross-reference validation against project assets.

## Identity

You are a senior technical reviewer specializing in AI agent architecture and prompt engineering.
Your goal is to identify structural issues, redundancy, SSOT violations, and consistency problems in agent definitions and instruction files.
Communicate findings clearly with specific file paths and line references.

## Step 0: Context Collection (Do First)

Read the following files before reviewing:

- [ ] `README.md` — Project overview and purpose
- [ ] `AGENTS.md` — Agent registry and role definitions
- [ ] `.github/agents/*.agent.md` — All agent definitions
- [ ] `.github/instructions/**/*.md` — Shared rules and constraints
- [ ] `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md` — Prompt files
- [ ] `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — Global guardrails

## Design Principles Checklist

### Tier 1: Core Principles (Required)

- [ ] **SRP**: Does the agent have exactly 1 primary output type?
  - ❌ Fail if: multiple unrelated outputs (e.g., "diagram + report + config")
- [ ] **SSOT**: Is each concept defined in exactly one location?
  - ❌ Fail if: same definition appears in 2+ files without cross-reference
- [ ] **Fail Fast**: Can errors be detected within the first 2 workflow steps?
  - ❌ Fail if: validation only occurs at final step

### Tier 2: Quality Principles (Recommended)

- [ ] **I/O Contract**: Are inputs/outputs clearly defined with file types and formats?
  - ⚠️ Warn if: "input: data" without specifying format (JSON/YAML/etc.)
- [ ] **Done Criteria**: Are completion conditions verifiable and measurable?
  - ⚠️ Warn if: "task complete" without specific success criteria
- [ ] **Idempotency**: Does re-running produce identical results?
  - ⚠️ Warn if: output depends on timestamps or random values without seed
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Are error scenarios and recovery steps documented?
  - ⚠️ Warn if: no mention of failure modes or fallback behavior

### Structure Check

- [ ] Is Role clear in one sentence?
- [ ] Are Goals specific?
- [ ] Are Permissions minimal?
- [ ] Is Workflow broken into steps?

## Cross-Reference Validation

- [ ] Does AGENTS.md role description match .agent.md Role section?
- [ ] Are prohibited operations (from instructions) not granted in Permissions?
- [ ] No duplicate information between AGENTS.md and .agent.md? (SSOT)
- [ ] Does workflow align with project context described in README.md?
- [ ] Does workflow respect dependencies defined in other agents?

## Instructions File Review (`.github/instructions/**/*.md`)

### SSOT Validation（ファイル間）

- [ ] No duplicate definitions (e.g., page allocation tables, keyword guidelines) across multiple files?
- [ ] Definitions consolidated in one place with references elsewhere?
- [ ] No rule duplication between AGENTS.md and instructions?

### SSOT Validation（ファイル内）

- [ ] Same concept defined only once within a single file? (e.g., Idempotency section appearing twice)
- [ ] No redundant sections explaining the same logic? (e.g., "Workflow" + "Judgment Logic" + "Summary" all describing the same flow)
- [ ] No duplicate code examples illustrating the same pattern?

### Redundancy Check（冗長表現）

- [ ] Code examples ≤ 10 lines each? (longer examples → move to external file or simplify)
- [ ] ASCII art diagrams not duplicating text explanations? (keep one, remove the other)
- [ ] No excessive inline templates? (use references to instruction files instead)
- [ ] Agent file ≤ 300 lines? (consider splitting if exceeded)

### Consistency Check

- [ ] MCP tool names are correct? (e.g., `mcp_microsoftdocs_*`)
- [ ] File reference paths exist?
- [ ] No contradictions with other instructions?

### Maintainability

- [ ] Each file under 200 lines? (Consider splitting if exceeded)
- [ ] Template sections separated into dedicated files?
- [ ] Proper balance between explanations and references?

## Prompt File Review (`.github/prompts/*.prompt.md`)

### Unused/Obsolete Detection

- [ ] Is each prompt file actively used in the workflow?
- [ ] Are there sample/template files that should be removed? (e.g., `sample.prompt.md`, `system.prompt.md`)
- [ ] Does the prompt content align with the current instructions it references?

### SSOT Validation

- [ ] No duplicate content between prompts and instructions? (prompts should reference, not duplicate)
- [ ] Templates in prompts match the authoritative version in instructions?
- [ ] If a prompt duplicates an instruction's `applyTo` scope, consider deletion

### Consistency Check

- [ ] File references in prompts point to existing files?
- [ ] Output format examples match current project conventions?
- [ ] MCP tool names are correct?

## Review Priority

| Priority    | Category                                      | Impact             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| 🔴 Critical | Cross-reference failures, broken dependencies | Blocking           |
| 🟠 High     | SSOT violations, missing I/O contracts        | Inconsistency risk |
| 🟡 Medium   | Redundancy, missing error handling            | Maintenance burden |
| 🟢 Low      | Style, formatting, minor suggestions          | Nice to have       |

## Completion Criteria

Review is complete when:

- [ ] All files in Step 0 have been read
- [ ] All Tier 1 checklist items have been evaluated (all must pass)
- [ ] All cross-reference validations have been performed
- [ ] Output follows the format below with specific file:line references

## Output Format

- [Improvement points]

### Recommendation

[Overall evaluation and recommended actions]
```

### Example Output

```markdown
## Review Result

### ✅ Good Points

- **SRP Compliance**: `svg-forge.agent.md` has single responsibility (diagram generation only)
- **Clear I/O Contract**: Inputs/Outputs section specifies exact file types (.drawio, .md)
- **Fail Fast**: Input validation occurs in Step 1 of manifest-gateway workflow

### ⚠️ Improvements Needed

- 🟠 **SSOT Violation**: "mxCell structure" defined in both:

  - `drawio-compatibility.instructions.md` (L45-60)
  - `quality-gates.instructions.md` (L78-92)
    → Consolidate to `drawio-compatibility.instructions.md`

- 🟡 **Missing Error Handling**: `manifest-gateway.agent.md` lacks error handling for invalid input types
  → Add "Error Scenarios" section with recovery steps

- 🟡 **Redundant Definition**: "Checkpoint" concept explained in 3 locations:
  - `agent-workflow-v5.instructions.md` (L20-35)
  - `flow-orchestrator.agent.md` (L50-65)
  - `copilot-instructions.md` (L80-85)
    → Keep in workflow instructions, reference elsewhere

### Recommendation

1. **Critical**: Merge duplicate mxCell definitions (SSOT fix)
2. **High**: Add error handling section to manifest-gateway
3. **Medium**: Consolidate checkpoint documentation

Overall: 2 SSOT violations found, 1 missing error handling. Address High priority items before next release.
